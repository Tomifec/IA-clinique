Electrospun nanofiber membranes have garnered significant attention because of their advantageous features, including a greater specific surface area, increased porosity, reduced thickness, and popularity. Consequently, ENMs have emerged as an up-and-coming contender in several applications. The various methods employed for fabrication involve inorganic deposition, polymer coating, and interfacial polymerization. Electrospun nanofiber membranes' efficacy in removing diverse water pollutants, including heavy metals, dyes, and antibiotics, has been exceptional. The enhancement of polymer membrane performance can be achieved through the precise adjustment of polymer structure, manipulation of surface properties, and reinforcement of total membrane porosity. The study investigates the fundamentals of electrospun nanofibers and their utilization in electrospun nanofibrous membranes and composites for environmental remediation applications. The final section discusses the opportunities and significant challenges concerning the application of engineered nanomaterials in the water treatment sector. The advancement of engineered nanomaterials is anticipated to facilitate the growth and application of multiple industries, including water treatment and sustainability.

Their precise mechanism of action is not known but it is postulated that they act by inhibiting the biosynthesis of certain prostaglandins. 1, 3, 4-oxadiazoles are a class of heterocyclic compounds with wide variety of biological and pharmacological activities. They have been reported to possess analgesic, antimicrobial, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds are also active against a number of other inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, gout etc. A wide variety of these compounds have been synthesized and some of them are under clinical trials. In this review article, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity of the 1, 3, 4- oxadiazole shall be discussed.
