paper does not specify effective mobilisation techniques for femoroacetabular impingement. It focuses on comparing physiotherapist-led strengthening versus stretching interventions, finding no significant difference in hip-related quality of life or perceived improvement between the two approaches. Open access•Journal Article•DOI 2. Therapeutic Exercise Approaches to Nonoperative and Postoperative Management of Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome. Sara Lynn Terrell +2 more 01 Jan 2021-Journal of Athletic Training PDF Summary Effective mobilization techniques for patients with femoroacetabular impingement include static stretching, myofascial release using lacrosse balls and foam rollers, and self-mobilization techniques like banded distraction, ensuring exercises do not elicit pain and are performed consistently. Journal Article•DOI 3. Prehab and Rehab for Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI): Clinical Pearls Aaron Horschig 15 Sep 2020-Techniques in Orthopaedics Request PDF 1 Improving joint mobility through posterior and lateral joint glide of the femur is effective for patients with femoroacetabular impingement. These techniques, combined with strengthening hip musculature and re-educating functional movement, can help decrease symptoms and enhance function. Journal Article•DOI 4. Rehabilitation for Femoroacetabular Impingement: Conservative Care and Postoperative Practice Mia S. Hagen +3 more 01 Dec 2018-Journal of wrist surgery Request PDF The paper indicates that there are limited experimental studies on effective mobilization techniques for femoroacetabular impingement. Current practices emphasize gentle passive range of motion, continuous passive motion machines, and specific exercises to minimize pain and improve joint function. Journal Article•DOI 5. Physiotherapy as an Initial Treatment Option for Femoroacetabular Impingement: A Systematic Review of the Literature and Meta-analysis of 5 Randomized Controlled Trials Graeme Hoit +7 more 01 Jul 2020-American Journal of Sports Medicine Request PDF The paper does not specify particular mobilization techniques for femoroacetabular impingement. However, it emphasizes that supervised physiotherapy programs focusing on active and core strengthening are more effective than unsupervised, passive, and non-core focused programs for improving patient outcomes. Open access•Journal Article•DOI 6. Current concepts in management of femoroacetabular impingement Adam S Wilson +1 more 18 Dec 2012-World journal of orthopedics Request PDF The paper does not specify particular mobilization techniques for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). It emphasizes surgical options like open surgical dislocation, mini-open, and arthroscopic surgery, focusing on improving joint clearance and reducing destructive forces across the joint surfaces. Journal Article•DOI 7. Efficacy of Physiotherapy Rehabilitation Program In Post Operative Management of Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome: A systemic Review of Clinical Evidence Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy—An International Journal Request PDF The paper does not specify particular mobilisation techniques for femoroacetabular impingement. It focuses on the overall efficacy of structured rehabilitation programs post-surgery, highlighting significant improvements in outcomes rather than detailing specific techniques. Open access•Journal Article•DOI 8. Conservative Physiotherapy Treatment of Femoroacetabular Impingement A. Nikolova +1 more 01 Oct 2022-Acta Medica Bulgarica PDF Summary The most effective mobilization techniques for femoroacetabular impingement include Deep Oscillation therapy for muscle stiffness, Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (Hold-Relax) for specific muscles, and kinesiotaping to relieve myofascial tension, enhancing muscle function and reducing pain.
