Recent studies have shown beneficial effects of cinnamon on metabolic biomarkers. Objective The objective of this review was to assess the effect of cinnamon supplementation on metabolic biomarkers in patients with DM2. Data Sources The Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase databases were searched up to November 10, 2022. Data Extraction A systematic search was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of cinnamon supplementation on metabolic biomarkers, in adults and the elderly with DM2, and comparing the data for a cinnamon intervention group with that for a placebo group or a control group. The main exclusion criteria were studies (1) with other types of diabetes (ie, gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes), (2) without cinnamon consumption, (3) that did not evaluate metabolic biomarkers, or (4) in vitro and animal studies. Two researchers independently screened 924 records, evaluated full-text studies, extracted data, and appraised their quality. A third researcher was consulted to resolve any discrepancies. The data were pooled using random-effects models and expressed as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran\u2019s Q test and quantified using I2 statistics. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) instrument. Sensitivity analysis and the GRADE system were used to assess the robustness and certainty of the findings. Data Analysis In total, 28 RCTs with a duration ranging from 30 to 120 days and a total enrollment of 3054 patients with DM2 were included. Participants consuming cinnamon showed a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose (FBG) (WMD: \u221215.26 mg/dL; 95% CI: \u221222.23 to \u22128.30; I2 = 88%), postprandial glucose (WMD: \u221239.22 mg/dL; 95% CI: \u221263.90 to \u221214.55; I2 = 100%), HbA1c (WMD: \u22120.56 mg/dL; 95% CI: \u22120.99 to \u22120.13; I2 = 94%), and HOMA-IR (WMD = \u22120.76, 95% CI: \u22121.13 to \u22120.39; I2 = 22%) compared with the control group. An intervention of cinnamon in capsule form reduced FBG (WMD:\u221218.43 mg/dL, 95% CI: \u221226.32 to \u221210.53; I2 = 89%), postprandial glucose (WMD: \u221244.83 mg/dL, 95% CI: \u221270.67 to \u221218.99; I2 = 100%), HbA1c (WMD: \u22120.56 mg/dL, 95% CI: \u22121.02 to \u22120.09; I2 = 94%), total cholesterol (WMD: \u221213.39 mg/dL; 95% CI: \u221224.71 to \u22122.07; I2 = 96%), LDL-C (WMD: \u22126.49 mg/dL, 95% CI: \u221212.69 to \u22120.29; I2 = 92%), and triglycerides (WND: \u221219.75 mg/dL; 95% CI, \u221233.71 to \u22125.80; I2 = 88%).
