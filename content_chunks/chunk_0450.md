While clinical aspects of spinal pain have been well-studied, understanding patients' personal narratives and lived experiences remains essential for enhancing patient-centered care, improving treatment adherence, and informing healthcare policies. It provides deep insights into the impacts of spinal pain, guiding more effective and empathetic treatment approaches. This systematic review aims to synthesize qualitative evidence on patients' experiences with MSK spinal pain, providing insight into the challenges faced, coping strategies, daily life impacts, and healthcare interactions. The objective of this review is to synthesize the qualitative evidence regarding the lived experiences of patients with MSK spinal pain.

In oncologic patients developing CLBP, it is critically important to perform further investigation to exclude spinal metastases (SM).The incidence of cancer is increasing, with 15.7\u201330% developing SM. In the case of symptomatic SM, we can distinguish three main categories: tumor pain; mechanical pain due to instability, with or without pathologic fractures; and metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) or radicular compression. Treatment of SM-related pain is dependent on these categories and consists of symptomatic treatment, target therapy to the bone, radiotherapy, systemic oncologic treatment, and surgery. The care for SM is a multidisciplinary concern, with rapid evolutions in all specialties involved. It is of primordial importance to incorporate the knowledge of specialists in all participating disciplines, such as oncology, radiotherapy, and spinal surgery, to determine the adequate treatment to preserve ambulatory function and quality of life while limiting the burden of treatment if possible. Awareness of potential SM is the first and most important step in the treatment of SM-related pain. Early diagnosis and timely treatment could prevent further deterioration. In this review, we explore the pathophysiology and symptomatology of SM and the treatment options for SM-related pain: tumor pain; mechanical pain due to instability, with or without pathologic fractures; and MESCC or radicular compression.", "authors": {"total": 4, "data": [{"display_name": "Ruben van den Brande", "id": 2429856465, "slug": "ruben-van-den-brande", "unique_id": "3h1i8j52f2", "full_slug": "ruben-van-den-brande-3h1i8j52f2", "affiliation_full_slug": "university-of-antwerp-2gqodjhv"}, {"display_name": "Charlotte Billiet", "full_slug": null}, {"display_name": "Marc Peeters", "full_slug": null}, {"display_name": "Erik Van de Kelft", "full_slug": null}]}, "affiliations": {"total": 1, "data": [{"display_name": "University of Antwerp", "city": "Antwerp", "region": null, "country": "Belgium", "id": 149213910, "slug": "university-of-antwerp", "unique_id": "2gqodjhv", "full_slug": "university-of-antwerp-2gqodjhv"}]}, "metrics": {"citations": {"total": null}}, "paper_url": "https://typeset.io/papers/spinal-metastases-of-the-vertebrae-three-main-categories-of-750a37jsalfb?utm_source=chatgpt"}], "query_url": "https://typeset.io/search?q=Extremity%20Pain%20of%20Spinal%20Source&utm_source=chatgpt"} --- **ASSISTANT**: Voici une sélection d'articles récents qui traitent de sujets similaires à l'étude **EXPOSS**, en lien avec la douleur des extrémités d'origine
