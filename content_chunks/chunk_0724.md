Scene 2: She bends one knee and lifts her foot behind her, preparing to grab the ankle. She looks focused.\n\n3. Scene 3: She grabs her ankle with the hand on the same side (homolateral), without pulling yet. Spine is neutral.\n\n4. Scene 4: Instruction overlay shows: \"Contract glutes and abdominals\".

Scene 6: She holds the stretch position steadily for 20 seconds.\n\n7. Scene 7: Relaxed return to neutral standing position, smiling calmly.\n\nStyle: realistic but simplified, clean lighting, full-body shots.", "size": "1024x1024" } --- **TOOL**: GPT-4o returned 1 images.
