inhibits cancer by suppressing inflammatory cytokines. Understanding their mechanisms of action is crucial for realizing therapeutic benefits. However, identifying suitable bioactive substances and comprehending their role in disease prevention are challenging. As we enter the functional food era, this review aims to present the current state of functional foods and nutraceuticals, exploring their applications for human wellness. Recognizing nutrition's individualized nature of nutrition is a central theme, emphasizing the importance of tailored dietary recommendations based on diverse responses to these functional elements, ensuring that personalized approaches are aligned with individual health goals.

Concrete piles have been installed for wave reduction in ports, while bamboo piles have been implemented as coastal protection structures. Researchers have studied extensively to assess the efficacy of these structures, specifically on wave transmission, reflection, and dissipation. On the other hand, concerns have recently arisen due to negative environmental effects associated with the poor durability of bamboo fences, leading to debris that poses a threat to the coastal ecosystem. This paper, guided by the Preferred Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Framework 2020, presents a comprehensive analysis of 48 peer-reviewed articles published between 2013 and 2024. The analysis reveals an evolving research trend of piles for wave protection. We found that publications that evaluate the environmental impacts and sustainability of piles as coastal protection structures are notably limited. Recognizing this gap, the paper discusses limitations and the way forward of applying piles in coastal environments. It also calls for an environmental impact assessment and community participation to be applied when installing piles, because the piles are not always environmentally friendly.
