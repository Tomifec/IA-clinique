An international survey of the comprehensiveness of the McKenzie classification system and the proportions of classifications and directional preferences in patients with spinal pain. Stephen May +1 more 01 Feb 2019-Musculoskeletal science and practice Request PDF 6 The study found that the McKenzie classification system identified Derangement as the most common classification (75.4%) among 750 patients, with a significant directional preference for extension (82.5%), indicating its relevance in managing spinal disorders effectively. Journal Article•DOI 18. Valutazione e trattamento meccanico delle radicolopatie discali lombari con il metodo McKenzie (MDT) G. Sagi 01 Jun 2012-EMC - Medicina Riabilitativa Request PDF Evidence indicates that the McKenzie Method (MDT) effectively addresses lumbar radiculopathies, promoting rapid symptomatic and functional improvement through directional preference exercises. Studies show significant benefits in pain intensity, analgesic use, and functional self-assessment, particularly in patients with reducible derangement syndromes. Journal Article•DOI 19. Letter to the Editor: Virtual McKenzie extension exercises for low back and leg pain: a prospective pilot exploratory case series. Journal of Manual and Manipulative Therapy, DOI:10.1080/10669817.2092822 Ronald Lee Schenk +1 more 08 Sep 2022-Journal of Manual & Manipulative Therapy Request PDF The McKenzie method (MDT) may effectively decrease pain in the short term and enhance long-term function for chronic low back pain, with directional preference associated with improvements in fear-avoidance beliefs, pain self-efficacy, depression, and psychological distress. Journal Article•DOI 20. Metodo McKenzie: diagnosi e terapia meccanica del rachide e delle estremità G Sagi +2 more 01 Jan 2011-EMC - Medicina Riabilitativa Request PDF 2 A systematic review in 2004 concluded that the McKenzie method yields greater short-term symptomatic and functional improvement for lumbar spine disorders compared to other approaches. However, evidence for its effectiveness in other spinal regions and extremity disorders remains insufficient. Journal Article•DOI 21. The McKenzie method compared with manipulation when used adjunctive to information and advice in low back pain patients presenting with centralization or peripheralization: a randomized controlled trial. Tom Petersen +5 more 15 Nov 2011-Spine Request PDF The study found the McKenzie method more effective than spinal manipulation for low back pain patients with centralization or peripheralization, showing a 71% success rate compared to 59% for manipulation, with significant improvements in disability at 2 and 12 months. Journal Article•DOI 22. Método McKenzie: diagnóstico y terapia mecánica de la columna vertebral y las extremidades G Sagi +2 more 01 Jan 2011-EMC - Kinesiterapia - Medicina Física Request PDF 1 Evidence shows that the McKenzie Method (MDT) effectively classifies spine disorders into three main syndromes: derangement, dysfunction, and postural. Studies indicate good interobserver reproducibility in assessments, particularly among trained therapists, enhancing patient autonomy in managing chronic pain. Open access•Journal Article 23.
