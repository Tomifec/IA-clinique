2020 to January 2021 at the Bone and Joint Center and Khyaban Medical Center. Participants were randomly assigned to Group A (n=16) receiving Mulligan Mobilization with Movement and conventional physiotherapy, and Group B (n=17) receiving Progressive Resistive Exercises and conventional therapy. Patients were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE), and hand dynamometer to measure pain intensity, functional status, and grip strength at baseline, after 5 sessions, 10 sessions, and at a 6-week follow-up. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements within group analyses. Group A showed a more substantial reduction in VAS scores and PRTEE scores, with median VAS scores decreasing from 7 to 2 (p=0.001) and PRTEE scores improving from 41 to 8 (p=0.001). Group B demonstrated greater improvements in pain-free grip strength, with median values increasing significantly at all time points (p&lt;0.05). Between-group analysis revealed that Group A had more significant improvements in VAS and PRTEE scores, while Group B had more significant improvements in pain-free grip strength. Conclusion: Mulligan Mobilization with Movement was more effective in reducing pain and improving functional status in patients with lateral epicondylitis compared to Progressive Resistive Exercises. However, Progressive Resistive Exercises were more effective in enhancing pain-free grip strength. These findings suggest the importance of tailored treatment approaches based on individual patient needs.

Object\u0131ve: This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the outcomes of Mulligan concept applications, including sustained natural apophyseal glides (SNAGS) and natural apophyseal glides (NAGS), in obese patients with MLBP. Methods: The study, conducted between January 2021 and June 2022 at a tertiary hospital, involved randomizing patients into two groups. Both groups underwent six sessions of stretching and strengthening exercises every other day. The Mulligan group received additional intervention with SNAG and NAGS techniques. Measurements were made regarding the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score and range of motion (ROM) for the patients\u2019 MLBP level. Results: Post-interventions, both groups exhibited positive changes in flexion ROM, extension ROM, right and left rotation ROM, right and left lateral flexion ROM, VAS score, and ODI score compared to pre-intervention (p &lt; 0.001 for both groups and variables). The Mulligan group showed a higher increase in ROM and a more significant decrease in VAS and ODI scores. Conclus\u0131ons: Mulligan mobilization techniques prove significantly beneficial for enhancing ROM in all directions, reducing pain levels, and alleviating disability in obese individuals with MLBP.
