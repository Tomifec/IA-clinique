        search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs in which (1) participants
        were adult workers with physically demanding work and MSD (including specific
        and non-specific MSD and musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, and discomfort),
        (2) interventions were initiated and/or carried out at the workplace, (3)
        a comparison group was included, and (4) a measure of MSD was reported (including
        musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, prevalence or discomfort).

  - text: Pour juger l’imprécision, l’examen des intervalles de confiance à 95% (IC95)
      est l’approche primaire; on abaisse la qualité si l’action clinique diffère
      selon que la borne basse ou haute est vraie.
    status: supported
    evidence:
    - source_url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839614/
      quote: GRADE suggests that examination of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provides
        the optimal primary approach to decisions regarding imprecision... rating
        down the quality of evidence is required if clinical action would differ if
        the upper versus the lower boundary of the CI represented the truth.

  - text: Même avec un effet important, si la taille d’échantillon et le nombre d’événements

    notes: Principe OIS pour juger l’information.
  - text: Pour les revues systématiques, une précision adéquate exige que l’IC95 exclue
      un RR=1.0 et que le nombre d’événements dépasse l’OIS; sinon, envisager une
      baisse pour imprécision.

        CI excludes a relative risk (RR) of 1.0, and the total number of events or
        patients exceeds the OIS criterion, precision is adequate. If the 95% CI includes
