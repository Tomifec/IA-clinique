      "abstract": "<jats:p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less then 60ml/min and albumin higher then 30mg/gm of creatinine along with structural abnormalities of kidney more than 3 months. When GFR &gt;15ml/min is known as End stage renal disease (ESRD). When the CKD progress towards ESRD, various treatment from a form of dialysis to transplantation is prescribed to prevent prognosis and extend the life expectancy. Renal rehabilitation (RR), same as other rehabilitative strategies is a holistic approach to provide multidimensional, coordinated intervention program designed to optimize unique treatment needs of CKD patient. RR is safe and enhances physical, psychological and social wellbeing of CKD or ESRD patient.(8,9) despite of its effectiveness itâ€™s not include in usual treatment regimen worldwide including India. an effort is made to analyze various literature and guidelines available about renal rehabilitation which will help in understanding clinical implications of renal rehabilitation in patient with CKD. Total 275 Articles were retrieved from various search engines through PubMed, PEDRO, Google scholar and Research gate ranging from year 2014 to 2024. The current review was conducted as per PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The prevalence of CKD is increasing day by day globally and also in India. Renal Rehabilitation is a multifaced team approach which can play significant role in improving physical and psychosocial wellbeing and Quality of life of patient with CKD at all stages including haemodialysis and transplantation.\n\nKeywords: Renal Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation, Chronic Kidney Disease</jats:p>",
