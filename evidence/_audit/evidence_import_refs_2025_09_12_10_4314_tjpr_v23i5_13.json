      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: To investigate the clinical efficacy of suspension training and Mulligan technique in combination with celecoxib in the  management of chronic lower back ache of unknown causes.\r\nMethods: A total of 100 subjects with persistent lower back pain of unknown etiology treated in the Sports Medical Rehabilitation Center, Shijiazhuang, China from June 2019 to December 2020, were assigned at random to control and study cohorts (n = 50/group). Celecoxib (100 to 200 mg/day) was taken orally, once or twice daily by  the control cohort, while the other cohort received suspension training, Mulligan technology (once a day, 8 weeks) and celecoxib. The  treatment effect, pain and dysfunction scores, inflammatory indicators, quality of life, and complications were compared on Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).\r\nResults: The effect of Macnab standard in study group was significantly better  than that in control group (p &lt; 0.05). After treatment, VAS and ODI scores in both cohorts were significantly lower than pretreatment  values, but were significantly lesser in the study cohort. Furthermore, TNF-α level, and levels of CRP and IL-6 were significantly reduced  when compared with pre-treatment levels, and were significantly lower in study cohort. The GQOL-74 scores in both groups were  significantly increased after treatment, but were significantly lower in the control cohort (p &lt; 0.05). No significant variations were seen in  cases of complications between both cohorts.\r\nConclusion: The use of suspension training and Mulligan technology in combination with  celecoxib in treating persistent lower back pain of unknown cause is beneficial in reducing lower back pain, mitigating dysfunction, and  improving patients' quality of life. There is however a need for more studies to validate these findings. </jats:p>",
