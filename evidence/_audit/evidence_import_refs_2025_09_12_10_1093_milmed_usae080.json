Functional restoration programs (FRPs), which combine psychological interventions and progressive exercise rehabilitation, represent an alternative to standard medical intervention for chronic pain. The objective of the current study is to evaluate a FRP serving Active Duty Service Members with chronic pain and to examine whether co-occurring PTSD symptoms are associated with differential treatment response.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This is a retrospective observational study of data previously collected at Naval Medical Center San Diego approved by the Naval Medical Center San Diego Institutional Review Board. The study included 81 Active Duty Service Members, primarily Sailors and Marines, who completed a FRP, and examined pre- to post-treatment changes in Pain Impact Score—a composite measure of pain intensity, pain interference, and physical functioning—as well as measures of mental health and pain cognitions. Co-occurring PTSD symptoms were examined as a potential moderator of treatment response.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Twenty-three patients (28.4%) screened positive for PTSD during baseline assessments. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed statistically significant improvement in Pain Impact Score for the full sample (P &amp;lt;.001). Although no significant interactions with probable PTSD were demonstrated for measures of pain intensity and physical functioning (both Ps &amp;gt;.05), patients screening positive for PTSD demonstrated a lesser decrease in pain interference compared to patients screening negative for PTSD (P &amp;lt;.01). Improvements in measures of mental health and pain cognitions were also statistically significant for the full sample (all P values &amp;lt;.05) and did not differ as a function of PTSD symptoms (all P values &amp;gt;.05).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This FRP primarily serving Sailors and Marines contributed to broad overall improvements in the domains of pain and functioning as well as mental health and pain cognitions. Co-occurring PTSD symptoms were not associated with poorer treatment response on most measured outcomes.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",
