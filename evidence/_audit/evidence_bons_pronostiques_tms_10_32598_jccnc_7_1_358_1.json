      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Organizational characteristics are the main concerns of nursing practice in acute care settings. The present study aimed to assess the organizational factors associated with nurses’ competence in averting Failure to Rescue (FTR) in acute care settings. Methods: This was a descriptive and correlational study. A purposive sampling technique was used to collect the necessary data from the study respondents. In total, 173 of the 204 eligible registered nurses providing sudden, urgent, and emergency direct care to patients in the identified acute care settings of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in Sagamu City, Nigeria participated in this study. A self-structured 38-item questionnaire, including 4 parts (demographic characteristics, knowledge on FTR, competence in averting FTR, &amp; organizational factors) was employed for data collection. The obtained data were analyzed in SPSS V. 22 using descriptive statistics (i.e. frequency, percentages, mean, standard deviation, &amp; tables) as well as Spearman’s Rho correlation to test the hypotheses based on the assumptions that the variables were measured on an ordinal scale at P&lt;0.05. Results: Most nurses presented a high level of knowledge regarding FTR with a mean score of 5.91. Besides, they were moderately competent in averting FTR with a mean score of 29.3. A significant correlation was also detected between organizational characteristics and the studied nurses’ level of competence in averting FTR (P=0.026). Conclusion: The present study data revealed that FTR could be reduced in acute care settings by the modification of organizational factors.</jats:p>",
